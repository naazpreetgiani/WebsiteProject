    <h2 id="about">History</h2>
    <p>
      In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical
      education was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He
      created a sport (basketball) in which players would pass a ball to
      teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass"
      due to the asymmetric shape of the early balls.

    <h2 id="about">Rules and regulations</h2>
    <p>
      There are many rules in basketball. When these rules are violated, the
      team in which who makes the violation forfeits possession of the ball.
      This includes but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking more than two steps without dribbling (travel)</li>
      <li>
        Dribbling with 2 hands or dribbling twice with a stop in between (double
        dribble)
      </li>
      <li>Placing a hand on the bottom of a ball within a dribble (carry)</li>
    </ul>
